# School Vaccination System Backend

This is the backend API for the School Vaccination Management System. It provides a RESTful API for managing students and vaccination drives.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Configure environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your_username:your_password@cluster0.mongodb.net/vaccination_app?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=5000
```

Replace `your_username`, `your_password` and `cluster0.mongodb.net` with your MongoDB Atlas credentials.

3. Run the server:
```
npm run dev
```
